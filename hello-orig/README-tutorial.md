  In this tutorial, you'll get a brief introduction to Go programming. Along the  way, you will:

- Install Go (if you haven't already).
- Write some simple "Hello, world" code.
- Use the `go` command to run your code.
- ​    Use the Go package discovery tool to find packages you can use in your own    code.  
- Call functions of an external module.

  **Note:** For other tutorials, see  [Tutorials](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/index.html).

## Prerequisites[¶](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#prerequisites)

- ​    **Some programming experience.** The code here is pretty    simple, but it helps to know something about functions.  
- ​    **A tool to edit your code.** Any text editor you have will    work fine. Most text editors have good support for Go. The most popular are    VSCode (free), GoLand (paid), and Vim (free).  
- ​    **A command terminal.** Go works well using any terminal on    Linux and Mac, and on PowerShell or cmd in Windows.  

## Install Go[¶](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#install)

Just use the [Download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install) steps.

## Write some code[¶](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#code)

  Get started with Hello, World.

1. ​    Open a command prompt and cd to your home directory.     

   ​      On Linux or Mac:    

   ```
   cd
   ```

   ​      On Windows:    

   ```
   cd %HOMEPATH%
   ```

2. ​    Create a hello directory for your first Go source code.     

   ​      For example, use the following commands:    

   ```
   mkdir hello
   cd hello
   ```

3. ​    Enable dependency tracking for your code.     

   ​      When your code imports packages contained in other modules, you manage      those dependencies through your code's own module. That module is defined      by a go.mod file that tracks the modules that provide those packages. That      go.mod file stays with your code, including in your source code      repository.    

   ​      To enable dependency tracking for your code by creating a go.mod file, run      the      [`go mod init`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-init) command,        giving it the name of the module your code will be in. The name is the        module's module path.

   In actual development, the module path will typically be the repository        location where your source code will be kept. For example, the module        path might be `github.com/mymodule`. If you plan to publish        your module for others to use, the module path *must* be a        location from which Go tools can download your module. For more about        naming a module with a module path, see        [Managing             dependencies](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#naming_module).    

   For the purposes of this tutorial, just use          `example/hello`.    

   ```
   $ go mod init example/hello
   go: creating new go.mod: module example/hello
   ```

4. In your text editor, create a file hello.go in which to write your code.

5. Paste the following code into your hello.go file and save the file.

   ```
   package main
   
   import "fmt"
   
   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   }
   ```

   ​      This is your Go code. In this code, you:    

   - ​        Declare a `main` package (a package is a way to group        functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory).      
   - ​        Import the popular        [`fmt` package](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt/),        which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the        console. This package is one of the        [standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std) packages you got        when you installed Go.      
   - ​        Implement a `main` function to print a message to the        console. A `main` function executes by default when you run        the `main` package.      

6. Run your code to see the greeting.

   ```
   $ go run .
   Hello, World!
   ```

   ​      The      [`go run`](https://go.dev/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program) command      is one of many `go` commands you'll use to get things done with      Go. Use the following command to get a list of the others:    

   ```
   $ go help
   ```

## Call code in an external package[¶](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#call)

  When you need your code to do something that might have been implemented by  someone else, you can look for a package that has functions you can use in  your code.

1. ​    Make your printed message a little more interesting with a function from an    external module.     

   1. ​        Visit pkg.go.dev and        [search for a "quote" package](https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=quote).      
   2. ​        In the search results, locate and click on the v1 of the `rsc.io/quote` package        (it should be listed with the "Other major versions" of `rsc.io/quote/v4`).      
   3. ​        In the **Documentation** section, under **Index**, note the        list of functions you can call from your code. You'll use the        `Go` function.      
   4. ​        At the top of this page, note that package `quote` is        included in the `rsc.io/quote` module.      

   ​      You can use the pkg.go.dev site to find published modules whose packages      have functions you can use in your own code. Packages are published in      modules -- like `rsc.io/quote` -- where others can use them.      Modules are improved with new versions over time, and you can upgrade your      code to use the improved versions.    

2. ​    In your Go code, import the `rsc.io/quote` package and add a call    to its `Go` function.     

   ​      After adding the highlighted lines, your code should include the      following:    

   ```
   package main
   
   import "fmt"
   
   import "rsc.io/quote"
   
   func main() {
       fmt.Println(quote.Go())
   }
   ```

3. ​    Add new module requirements and sums.     

   ​      Go will add the `quote` module as a requirement, as well as a      go.sum file for use in authenticating the module. For more, see      [Authenticating modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod#authenticating) in the Go      Modules Reference.    

   ```
   $ go mod tidy
   go: finding module for package rsc.io/quote
   go: found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
   ```

4. ​    Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling.     

   ```
   $ go run .
   Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
   ```

   ​      Notice that your code calls the `Go` function, printing a      clever message about communication.    

   ​      When you ran `go mod tidy`, it located and downloaded the      `rsc.io/quote` module that contains the package you imported.      By default, it downloaded the latest version -- v1.5.2.    

## Write more code[¶](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#write-more)

  With this quick introduction, you got Go installed and learned some of the  basics. To write some more code with another tutorial, take a look at  [Create a Go module](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module.html).
